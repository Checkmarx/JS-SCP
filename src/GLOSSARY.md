## Hazardous Characters

Any character or encoded representation of a character that can effect the
intended operation of the application or associated system by being interpreted
to have a special meaning, outside the intended use of the character. These
characters may be used to:

* Altering the structure of existing code or statements
* Inserting new unintended code
* Altering paths
* Causing unexpected outcomes from program functions or routines
* Causing error conditions
* Having any of the above effects on down stream applications or systems

## Regular Expression

A regular expression (regex or regexp for short) is a special text string for describing a search pattern. ([source][1])

## ReDoS

Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service attack,
that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach
extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly (exponentially related
to input size).

## dot-dot-slash

Path alteration characters like `../` and `..\`

## Sanitization

Sanitization refers to the process of removing or replacing submitted data to
ensure that it is valid and safe.
